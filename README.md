# Dockerized Smarthome

This repo is essentially listing all the services I want to run in my smarthome server in a docker-compose format.

## Services

Listing all the services included so far in the [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yml), a small note of why/what I'm going to use it for, and some installations notes in case any further step is needed.

### Zigbee2MQTT

**URL:** <https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/>

**Why:** So far I've been a HomeKit hard user, and I'm looking forward for Matter and Thread to keep making live easier and cheaper for me.

However, there is a moment in the HomeKit user where you wonder _what if there was a communication layer that is more or less standard, so
I can rely on different brands and vendors without buying hubs for each one of them?_.

It looks like Z2M is the answer for Zigbee-based devices.

**Installation:** Copy the [configuration.base.yaml](./data/zigbee2mqtt/configuration.base.yaml) to `data/zigbee2mqtt/configuration.yaml`

```bash
cp data/zigbee2mqtt/configuration.base.yaml data/zigbee2mqtt/configuration.yaml
```

And make sure the `ttyUSB0` still matches the name associated to your Zigbee dongle (`sudo dmesg` can help with figuring it out). This check needs to happen in `configuration.yaml` and `docker-compose.yml`.

### Mosquitto

**URL:** <https://mosquitto.org>

**Why:** Simply because I need an MQTT server for Zigbee2MQTT and it's the suggested one by Zigbee2MQTT docs.

### Home Assistant

**URL:** <https://www.home-assistant.io/>

**Why:** While I'm a hard HomeKit user for now (we'll see if Matter will change that), I want to start exploring HA to see what all the fuzz is about. It also helps me bridge Z2M devices to HomeKit. However, I'm still in exploration phase... I might use [`homebridge-z2m`](https://github.com/itavero/homebridge-z2m) in the future instead.

### Matter Server

**URL:** <https://github.com/home-assistant-libs/python-matter-server>

**Why:** Needed by Home Assistant to support Matter devices ([docs](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/matter)).

### Duplicati

**URL:** <https://www.duplicati.com>

**Why:** We all need a backup! All the services in this project generate a lot of files worth of creating backups of: secrets, pairing tokens, autogenerated configurations (from UI actions), and DBs. The idea is to back up the entire `/data` directory.

**Installation:** Once the container is running, open `http://host:8200` in your browser to set up (or restore) the backups. If restoring a previous backup, make sure the affected service is stopped before restoring the files.

DISCLAIMER: Duplicati dropped support for the architecture `linux/arm/v7` because the managing the underlying libraries and dependencies in this architecture was too complex. If running on a Raspberry Pi, make sure it's running a 64 bits OS.

### Homebridge

**URL**: <https://homebridge.io>

**Why:** As a HomeKit user, there are devices that would make a great addition to my automations, but they are not officially supported by this platform. I've been using this project for a long while, and I've already found out Home Assistant cannot fully replace it.

**Installation:** Copy the [homebridge.base.env](./data/homebridge/homebridge.base.env) to `./data/homebridge/homebridge.env`

```bash
cp ./data/homebridge/homebridge.base.env ./data/homebridge/homebridge.env
```

And set the environment variables as needed.

DISCLAIMER: I'm using a private Docker image for the time being. So other folks might not be able to run it. I'll try to anonymize the other project, so I can make it public, and so the Docker image.

### AdGuard Home

**URL**: <https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome>

**Why:** Free local DNS-based ad-blocker that I can set at the router level. Do I need to explain why?

**Installation:** Once running, set the router to the IP of the host running this service.

### Remote Access

For remote access I need to use 2 additional services: a Dynamic DNS and a VPN.

#### Dynamic DNS: DuckDNS

**URL:** <https://www.duckdns.org>

**Why:** We need a service that allows us to have a domain that points to our public IP. Typically, the public IP in our router is not static and rotates from time to time. This service would make sure we can point to a static DNS that translates to the current public IP.

**Installation:** Copy the [duckdns.base.env](./data/duckdns/duckdns.base.env) to `./data/duckdns/duckdns.env`

```bash
cp ./data/duckdns/duckdns.base.env ./data/duckdns/duckdns.env
```

And set the environment variables as needed. Documentation on the settings to this service can be found in the official README: <https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/duckdns>

Typically, it's just defining the subdomain that was created in the website, and the token retrieved from the website.

#### VPN: WireGuard

**URL:** <https://www.wireguard.com>

**Why:** I may need remote access to the system from time to time in case something doesn't work as expected. I've read WireGuard is better than OpenVPN, and much simpler to use, so I looked no-more.

**Installation:** Copy the [wireguard.base.env](./data/wireguard/wireguard.base.env) to `./data/wireguard/wireguard.env`

```bash
cp ./data/wireguard/wireguard.base.env ./data/wireguard/wireguard.env
```

And set the environment variables as needed. Documentation on the settings to this service can be found in the official README: <https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-wireguard>

Typically, it's just about updating the `SERVERURL` to match the domain obtained from DuckDNS.

:warning: Remember to enable port forwarding to 51820/udp in the router.

### Hotspot

I'm using a hotspot service so my RPi can expose a Wi-Fi AP that I can connect to when I need to take it to a place with no internet.

I'm leveraging the `profiles` feature of docker-compose to avoid running this image all the time. To enable it, I need to run either:

```bash
docker-compose up hotspot -d
```

or

```bash
docker-compose --profile no-network up -d
```
